## Setup Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure all the necessary Python libraries are installed. You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the project:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open `main.ipynb`.

5. **Execute the Notebook**: Run the cells in `main.ipynb` sequentially to execute the project.

Ensure your environment is set up correctly with all dependencies installed to avoid any issues during execution.
